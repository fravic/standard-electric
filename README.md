# Standard Electric

An online multiplayer competitive strategy game focused on power grid management and electrical infrastructure.

## Game Overview

Standard Electric is a strategic bidding game where players manage and expand an electrical power company. The core gameplay revolves around:

- Bidding on power plant rights
- Building and connecting power infrastructure
- Managing power generation and distribution
- Balancing supply and demand across the grid
- Upgrading and optimizing the power network

### Core Mechanics

1. **Power Grid Management**

   - Build power plants (coal, solar, etc.)
   - Connect buildings with power lines
   - Monitor power flow and capacity
   - Handle blackouts and grid failures

2. **Building System**

   - Hex-based grid system
   - Various building types (power plants, poles, substations)
   - Power line connections between buildings
   - Resource management for power generation

3. **Economic System**
   - Resource costs for construction
   - Maintenance costs
   - Fuel costs
   - Power delivery revenue
   - Research and upgrades

## Technical Architecture

### Key Components

- **UI components**: `src/components`
- **Game State Machine (xState, actor-kit)**: `src/actor`
- **Buildables (power plants, power poles, etc):**: `src/lib/buildables/`
- **Grid System**: `src/lib/HexGrid`
- **Power System**: `src/lib/power/`

### Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- XState (for state management)
- Three.js (for 3D rendering)

## Development

Run the development server (Remix + Cloudflare):

```sh
bun run dev
```

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

2. Set up environment variables (modify these as necessary):

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
cp .wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
```

3. This game is intended to run primarily on mobile, so you may want to accept requests from your phone to your dev machine. To do this, install and run ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http --url=your-ngrok-url.ngrok.app 8787
```

You'll also need to update your ACTOR_KIT_HOST env var in dev.vars to `your-ngrok-url.ngrok.app`.

## Tests

```sh
bun test
```

## Deployment

Deploy your app to Cloudflare Pages:

```sh
bun run deploy
```

## Contributing

When working on this codebase, keep in mind:

1. The game uses a hex-based grid system for all building placement
2. Power systems are core to gameplay - changes should maintain power mechanics integrity
3. The state machine in `game.machine.ts` controls core game flow
4. Building types are defined in `lib/buildables/` and must implement the `Buildable` interface
