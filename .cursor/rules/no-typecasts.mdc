# Avoid Type Casting
- Avoid using type assertions like `as Type` whenever possible
- Instead, prefer to properly define interfaces, unions and type parameters
- If needed, prefer type guards (`is` functions) over type assertions
- When interacting with external APIs, use proper type definitions rather than force-casting
- When handling possibly null/undefined values, prefer to use proper nullable types in interfaces rather than casting
- For component props, always include null/undefined in the type definition if it can accept those values
