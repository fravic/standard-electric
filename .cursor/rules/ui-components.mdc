# Use existing UI components

This rule is helpful whenever creating or modifying UI elements

- Always use existing UI components (like Card, Button, TextInput, etc.) instead of creating new ones from scratch
- Check for existing components in the UI folder before implementing custom elements
- Maintain consistent styling by leveraging our component library
- For inputs, use TextInput component rather than raw HTML inputs
