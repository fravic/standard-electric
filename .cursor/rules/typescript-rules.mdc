# Rules for Typescript
- Never use `any` to override typings
- Avoid excessive or redundant comments
- Never attempt to run the project using `bun dev` or `bun storybook`; programmer will check the output manually
- If there are more than two arguments to a function, use an object as input to name the arguments
